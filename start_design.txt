# Where do we start

* we should be able to quickly look at the screen and be able to tell which window type we are in

Window Types:
* Overworld
* Map
* Start Menu
* Pokemon View
* Backpack

Maybe we can abstract the above?
For starters we can implement them directly and then see if we can make it figure it out on its own

Action outputs should be buttons only
if we want to get to a menu, it should have to figure out how to get there

## Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM!!!!)
* the agent needs to have some concept of where it is
* agent location needs to be part of the state
* we probably need to be able to do some math to figure out if we're actually in
    a state that we've been before
* the visual indicators on the screen should be generally uniquely identifying
